## Fortran

This project is as much about trying a simple game idea as about learning Fortran 77.  
Since it it surprisingly hard to get a F77 compiler on Windows these days we use Mingw/GCC's gfortran which only supports >=F95.
Inevitably we drag in F95 features, but the SDL C bindings we need wouldn't be feasible anyways (at least not without compiler extensions).  
So instead we just modified a few compiler settings to get closer to that dusty F77 feel (most notably using fixed form code)
